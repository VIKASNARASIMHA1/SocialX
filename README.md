# SocialX

This repository contains SQL queries designed for interacting with the database of a social media platform - SocialX. The queries allow for performing database operations such as retrieving data, inserting records, updating data, and analyzing user interactions. These queries are intended to be used in a MySQL environment.

## Database Schema Overview

The platform's database consists of the following 9 tables:

1. **users**: Stores user account information (e.g., username, email, password).

2. **user_profiles**: Contains additional user information such as bio, date of birth, gender, etc.

3. **posts**: Stores posts made by users, including content, media, and timestamps.

4. **likes**: Tracks likes on posts by users.

5. **comments**: Stores comments made by users on posts.

6. **messages**: Contains messages exchanged between users.

7. **notifications**: Stores notifications related to posts, comments, likes, and messages.

8. **post_shares**: Tracks when users share posts.

9. **followers**: Tracks user-following relationships between users.
